# day2day-risk-assessment

Hi ! ğŸ‘‹

This is a hackathon project made in 48h for the company Bunge.

It's the fruit of the collaboration between Xavier Piquet, AurÃ©lie Chapuis, PÃ©rinne RÃ©gnier, Guillaume Loiseau and Charles Girouard

The result is a Streamlit interface that converts a raw database into a transformed table to calculate the daily risks on the prices of agricultural products.

Here is the streamlit link : https://day2day-risk-assessment-dqtt4j5r4pg.streamlit.app

Enjoy ! ğŸ˜š
